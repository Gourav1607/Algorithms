a) G= (V, E), where V=no of points, E=number of edges (similarity between data point).
b) Compute the MST, G’= (V, E’) where E’ ? E from G.
c) Compute the second round MST, G’’= (V, E’’), where E’’?E from G= (V, E) & E=E- E’.

Write a program to construct the MST neighbourhood graph Gmst= (V, E’+E’’) and write the output (adjacent vertices of each vertex) into G_MST.txt.
